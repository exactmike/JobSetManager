# Issues / To Do

- [x] when restarting a job processing loop some start/end times are lost on jobs.  Need to detangle requiredjobs and definedjobs in invoke-jsmprocessingloop
- [ ] make RequiredJobs a hashtable just like the other *jobs variables
- [x] fix the notification settings
- [ ] make set-jsmperiodicreportsetting leave current values in place and only set what is specified each time it is used
